# Metro-Retro
Modern retail website for vintage mid century furniture dealer

Metro Retro's original website was comprised solely of HTML and jpeg images. It lacked robust structure, styling, adequate UI, and the site's UX left much to be desired. 

The current iteration of Metro Retro's website is retrofitted with Backbone's MVC structure. This powerful javascript library has built-in event handling and data validation on the model, plus built-in methods that handle DOM events and template rendering via router logic.
